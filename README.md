Why Crocetti? Well, if you like Sinatra (The singer) you may heard of Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 â€“ December 25, 1995). That's the source of this CMS name.

## Description

Crocetti is a very simple but very powerful CMS System that has no dependencies in Database Storage. It can manage assets, routes, templates, tags and integration with other code. Crocetti comes with a Renderer (For content output), Admin (For Content administration) and API (For integration).

Crocetti was designed to work as an API with an HTML5 interface, so it can get along with Bootstrap, Angular, etc. By default, the admin comes with a proprietary set of libraries on top of Bootstrap 3.
